<p><b>How to sell an item :</b></p>

<p>
-> To get an idea of the demand for your product and the pricing of your competitors,
  search for items similar to those youâ€™ve chosen to sell. Review items currently for sale.
</p>
<p>
    Try these tips for a successful sale:</br>
       --Understand the buyerâ€™s perspective.</br>
       --Search for a similar item on eBay and review the item through a buyerâ€™s eyes.</br>
       --Take note of which information you find essential in making a purchase decision.</br>
       --Pricing it right is the key to getting the sale. Find out what items like yours are selling for</br>
</p>
<p>
-> Write a description that sells
  Itâ€™s a good idea to draft your title and description in advance so you can copy and paste them into the seller form. Youâ€™ll have a chance
  to edit them further.
</p>
<p>
-> Craft an effective title
    --Make the most of your title by carefully choosing keywords a buyer might use when searching.
    --Use descriptive keywords, with no punctuation.
    --Use all 80 characters allowed for the title. Include the brand name, size, color, fabric, if the item is new, etc.
</p>
<p>
-> Wherever relevant, include dimensions (e.g., 5x8) or technical specs like 4GB.
</p>
<p>
-> Any notable additional features which might attract buyers.
</p>
<p>
-> Avoid using words like rare,beautiful,unusual etc. 
  No one uses these words when theyâ€™re searching. A good example of a title for the item we are about to sell is 
    "Nikon Coolpix S550 10 Megapixel Digital Camera Blue with Charger and Battery"
</p>
<p>
-> Set your start price based on the prices and demand you saw in your research, and no lower than the lowest price youâ€™re willing to take.
</p>
<p>
-> Select a category (You may also browse categories to select the best fit for your item.)
</p>
<p>
Enter some descriptive keywords into the textbox. Some items such asâ€¨cameras, electronics,books, CDs and video games may be available in the eBay Catalog and will appear as you type
in your item, or you can click the Search button.
When your item matches content already in the Database, the description, item specifics
and a stock photo are automatically added to your listing.
